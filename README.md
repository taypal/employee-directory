Team Member Tracker

REACT APP

User:
The user should be able to use the app to search, filter, and sort between the "dream squad" from the movie inception. 


How it works: 

*Page loads and the table of the team member appears

*Next the user chooses if they want to filter the members by their role 

*Or the user chooses to sort the table by "name" or "role"

*The user does have the option to reset the form and/or webpage
